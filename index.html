<h1>Dogs in the USA</h1>
<p> 
70 - 80 million dogs owned in the US. It's impossible to say how many strays there are, <br> but overpopulation is a problem.</p>
<br>
<p>
Of the dogs entering shelters, approximately 35% are adopted, <br>31% are euthanized (some sick, some healthy) and 26% of dogs <br> who came in as strays are returned to their owner.

<h1 id="Sweden-info-heading"> To put this in perspective... </h1>

<div id="Sweden-info-text">
<h3>In Sweden, there are about 820 000 dogs registered, and approximately 30 300 dogs are born every year. 
There are many organizations and shelters devoted to helping strays and lost dogs. Hundstallet, a big dog shelter in Stockholm reunite about 300 dogs with their owners every year, and about 100 strays are adopted. They do not euthanize healthy dogs and  
try to get the dogs a home as soon as possible.</h3>

<h2>So in Sweden, things are looking a lot better. Please consider adopting a shelter dog, they deserve a good life too.</h2>
